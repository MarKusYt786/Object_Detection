# 🧠 Real-Time Object Detection
The Real-Time Object Detection is a web application that utilizes machine learning models to detect objects in real-time video feeds. This project aims to provide a seamless and interactive experience for users, allowing them to detect objects in their surroundings using their device's camera. The core features of this project include real-time object detection, video feed display, and detected object visualization.

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-Time Object Detection**: The application can detect objects in real-time video feeds using the COCO-SSD model.
- **Video Feed Display**: The application displays the live video feed from the user's camera.
- **Detected Object Visualization**: The application draws rectangles around the detected objects and displays their class labels and confidence scores.
- **Machine Learning Model Integration**: The application utilizes the TensorFlow.js library and the COCO-SSD model for object detection.
- **Interactive User Experience**: The application provides an interactive experience for users, allowing them to detect objects in their surroundings.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: None (client-side application)
- **Machine Learning Library**: TensorFlow.js
- **Object Detection Model**: COCO-SSD
- **Dependencies**: `@tensorflow/tfjs`, `@tensorflow-models/coco-ssd`
